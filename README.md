AntiAura (checkaura) is a simple plugin that allows you to check if someone has killaura.

It needs ProtocolLib as dependency.

This fork is based on [Dmck2b's extension with more features](https://github.com/Dmck2b/AntiAura),
but also includes the [1.9 update from upstream](https://github.com/maciekmm/AntiAura) and
has been made compatible with Minecraft 1.11.
